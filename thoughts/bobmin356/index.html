<title>Fanfiction and Death</title>

<p>Today I found out my favorite fanfiction author has been dead for several years. I never thought to check his bio until now, and apparently he was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2016. According to a Reddit search, he died later that year. I only found his and his wife's shared account last year, but quickly fell in love with their ability to write both emotionally impactful and also preposterous stories, capped with equally...interesting disclaimers.</p>
<p>Regular grief aside, it's been giving me some uncomfortable thoughts. Is it weird to grieve someone who died years before I even knew he existed? How many others are there like him? I've found a lot of abandoned projects online, and not just fanfiction- video games that were never completed, websites that look like they're stuck in 2003, domains that have been stripped down to nothing but a farewell message to a fanbase I never had a chance to be a part of, discord servers that abruptly turned into something else before self-combusting, etc. How many of those were left behind voluntarily, due to a change of interest or shifting hobbies? How many were abandoned because their creators had no choice, due to a lack of energy or money?  These questions have always lurked at the back of my mind, benignly curious, but this new revelation adds a newer, darker one to the mix. </p>
<p><b>How many of them are still alive?</b></p>
